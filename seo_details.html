      <h2>Managed SEO</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Service Details</h3>
       <p class="highlight">Keyword, Geographic, and Competitive Market Research</p>
          <p>At the launch of our SEO services, we’ll perform research into keywords, geographical targets and local competitors to identify opportunities right from the start. We’ll utilize this research, along with input from the clients, to generate a keyword list to target and to help build out an initial strategy.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Search Engine Verification</p>
          <p>We verify all of our SEO clients in Google Webmaster Tools and Bing Webmaster Tools. These accounts provide a wealth of data related to the health of the site and are used for finding opportunities and identifying potential issues. </p>

        <p class="highlight">Initial Website Optimization</p>
          <p>At the launch of the SEO service, we’ll optimize the core areas of the website-homepage, new inventory page, used inventory page, financing page, parts page, service page, body shop page, and the about us page. This initial optimization includes customized HTML content, internal linking, and custom meta data aimed at increasing search engine visibility for keyword targets. </p>

        <p class="highlight">Forensic SEO</p>
          <p>If we discover that a site is experiencing organic search-related performance issues, we’ll utilize our platform expertise to quickly diagnose the problem and come up with a plan for recovery.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Weekly Keyword Ranking Reports</p>
          <p>After the research has been completed, we’ll enter the keyword list into our tracking software. This tool will check Google, Bing and Yahoo each week to see how the website is performing in the organic search results over time.</p>

        <p class="highlight">SEO Reports</p>
          <p>We provide a custom SEO report to all of our SEO clients. Advanced SEO clients receive the report quarterly and Premium SEO clients receive the report monthly. These reports showcase data about the website’s performance, including traffic, conversion and keyword ranking metrics.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Analyst Insights</p>
          <p>All of our SEO clients receive handwritten performance insights that are included with the SEO report mentioned above. These insights provide expert analysis of clients’ websites and strategy. Advanced SEO is quarterly and Premium SEO is monthly.</p>
        
        <p class="highlight">Ongoing Optimization</p>
          <p>On a recurring basis, our SEO analysts will review the performance of the website before creating and then implementing a strategy. Advanced SEO clients get a “re-opt” on a quarterly basis that is focused on general automotive SEO improvements for the OEMs the dealership sells. Premium SEO clients get this type of work on a monthly basis, but is based on the strategy developed in coordination with the client and includes strategic, goal-based content (see details below). </p>

        <p class="highlight">Mobile Optimization</p>
          <p>Because mobile experience is so important, we focus website optimization from a mobile perspective. Since Seamless was built with customization in mind, we are able to easily switch to the mobile version of any page and optimize accordingly. Many times this means that we’ll reduce the amount of content/images/video on a page so that it loads much faster and provides an optimized experience for mobile users.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Schema.org Implementation</p>
          <p>Upon the initial optimization, we’ll implement basic schema.org microdata that is designed specifically for autodealers–schema.org/AutoDealer–on the homepage of the site.</p>

          <p class="highlight">Link/Citation Building</p>
          <p>We focus our link and citation building on highly trusted, local business listing websites for our Advanced SEO clients. For our Premium SEO clients, we also create custom strategies with the client. Many times this involves obtaining links from non-profit partners, local business partners, and charities that the dealership is involved with.</p>

          <p class="highlight">Model Specific Landing Pages</p>
          <p>Our SEO services come with system-generated model specific landing pages. Analysts will often optimize these pages further as custom landing pages, depending on the strategy for the client and competition in the marketplace.</p>
         
          <p class="highlight">SEO and Web Presence Audit</p>
          <p>During the first month of Premium SEO, we’ll perform an in-depth audit of the clients’ SEO and their web presence. We’ll look at websites’ current status and provide action items based on what we find. We’ll also look at how dealerships are positioned on the web, from the Facebook page to Yelp to Google+ and beyond. We’ll provide a review and go over the action items with clients on the phone or via email. </p>

          <p class="highlight">Content</p>
          <p>All of our SEO clients receive custom pages on a recurring basis (quarterly for Advanced SEO and monthly for Premium SEO). These pages are built based on a defined strategy and may include model specific pages, fixed ops-related pages, comparison pages, custom directions pages, etc.</p>

          <p class="highlight">Strategy and Review Calls</p>
          <p>Each month for Premium SEO clients, we’ll schedule a call to discuss the performance of the previous month’s strategy and to create a plan for the months moving forward. During this call, we’ll go over the SEO report and the Analysts’ insights to provide any additional context for clients.</p>

          <p class="highlight">Direct Access to Senior Analyst</p>
          <p>Premium SEO accounts have direct access to their Senior Analyst via email and phone. Clients are free to contact their Analyst at any time during normal business hours for questions or discussions related to SEO.</p>
